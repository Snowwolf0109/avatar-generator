# Real-Time Avatar Speech (AI personalised bot with avatar)
This project utlises fastRAG and openvino from Intel. I will link the requirements.txt file but prefer working on this projetc in virtual environment.
Can be used with CPU, GPU & NPU if already set up. 

This project build on the backend side only so it will be a raw code, and note that for avatar generation, I have implemented openCV and a python library call simpleaudio.
Do check those out!
Thanks.
